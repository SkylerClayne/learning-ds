# Data Structures and Algorithms

-------------------------------------
:dash: :kiss: :gun:

## Description

  Contains fully implemented projects from 2nd year algorithms at York University.  
  Terrible, terrible code but I keep it as a reference point to see where I've came from and how my abilities have came along. So many things I would like to change but that would dampen my sorry memories.  #prodigalcoder 
  
  All code written in Java.
